# Reliability-Analysis-of-VVVFD-Motor
This was a research about given to me by BHEL BHOPAL for finding the solution and a better way of detection failures in RPM , Thus to solve this I have used Anomaly detection Algorithm

Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive reliability analysis of a 300 kW variable voltage variable frequency drive (VVVFD) system along with its associated controller. The VVVFD system, a critical component in various industrial applications, necessitates robust performance and uptime to ensure operational efficiency and safety. The primary objective of this research is to assess the reliability
characteristics of the VVVFD system and its controller, identifying potential failure modes, estimating their probabilities, and devising strategies to enhance overall system reliability. Through a combination of theoretical modeling, empirical data analysis, and simulation techniques, this study offers insights into the systemâ€™s operational behavior,
failure patterns, and mitigation strategies. The results of this analysis contribute to informed decision-making in maintenance scheduling, design improvements, and re- source allocation for ensuring sustained and dependable VVVFD system performance. To the best of our knowledge, in literature, there are only a few contributions towards Reliability detection using the PTC windchill software, and
failure rate detection using anomaly detection.
